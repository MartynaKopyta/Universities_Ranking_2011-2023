## Universities_Ranking_2011-2023

This repository was created for learning purposes. 

I am using the dataset "THE World University Rankings 2011-2023" from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/r1chardson/the-world-university-rankings-2011-2023

Notebooks included in this repo contain methods of drawing graphs using plotly, merging multiple csv files into one
as well as some methods of dealing with null values.
